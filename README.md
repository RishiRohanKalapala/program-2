# Sample Webpage Using Bootstrap

This is a simple webpage created using Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, along with some custom styling and JavaScript for interactive features.

## Description

The webpage consists of a header section with a jumbotron, followed by a container with four columns of content.

### Header (Jumbotron)

- The header contains a large heading (`<h1>`) and a tagline (`<h3>`), both of which can be edited directly on the webpage.

### Content Columns

- There are four content columns, each occupying one-quarter of the container's width on small screens and adjusting dynamically on larger screens (responsive design).
- Each column has a title (`Column 1`, `Column 2`, etc.) and a paragraph of content below it.
- The column titles are styled to be bold and have a dark color.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need a web browser installed on your computer.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

- Edit the heading and tagline in the jumbotron directly on the webpage by clicking on them.
- Modify the content of each column by editing the HTML code within the `<div>` elements with the class `col-sm-3`.

## Customization

You can customize the webpage by:

- Changing the heading and tagline in the jumbotron.
- Modifying the content of each column.
- Adjusting the styling in the `<style>` section to change colors, fonts, etc.
- Adding or removing columns as needed by duplicating or removing the `<div>` elements with the class `col-sm-3`.
